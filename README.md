# Wind Energy Prediction
 The task is to predict the wind energy produced by an onshore wind farm. The measurements has been recorded in 15-minute sections from January 2016 to June 2017, and the wind energy generated by these measurements. These represents the training data

The test data is measurements for the second half of 2017. Predictions will be made with this data. The results of the prediction will be compared to the actual recorded measurements.
